			"contents": "# Embark Worms submission 'diary'\n\nTomas Möre 2023\n\nI wrote the problems I've encoutered during with notes on how and why I solved it that way.\nSkimming thoguht this should give you a rough idea about what I did.\n\nThis document is not well structured but is roughly chronological.\n\nMost minor fixes not deemed imporant are left out of this document.\n\n\n## Hours spent\nAround 10? Lost count.\n\nLost embarassingly long time to a bug that would have been caught with\nstricter compiler warnings.\n\n\n## Default worm length length\nDecrease default length 5 as specified by the assignment.\n\n## Worm stretched out while boosting\nCause: boosting increases distance between the circles of the\nworm.\n\nSimplest solution:\nMaking boost decrease the step time of the worm instead. This will make the movement in the two modes identical. Possible negative impact: increased computation.\n\n\n## Turning speed not satisfying:\nIntroduce a target the worm wants to reach.\nThe mouse doesn't directly move the worms direction, rather, with\neach update the worm will turn at a certain speed in the direction of the desired position.\n\n\n## Minor update \"fix\"\nIn case we would have missed some desired updates, we're making sure to catch up by looping over the actual update several times.\nMight not be desired behaviour. Depends on \"correctness\" vs performance, I tend to prefer correctness.\n\n\n## AI spawn\nIt is preferable to spawn the AI Worms a little bit randomly every time, to \"spice\" it up a\nlittle. However we also need to make sure that the AI's don't spawn too close to the player as that wouldn't be satisfying either.\n\nI decided to introduce a `SafeStartingArea` box in which enemies aren't allowed to spawn. The spawn\nwill simply re-randomize the starting area if inside this box, while one could of course\ndo some math to reach the same results. However it would be more complicated code and wouldn't do a\npractical difference in our case.\n\n\n\n## Storage and handling of worms\nThe initial implementation had a separate field in the class for the player and the player worms, to\nmake things logically simpler I instead create an array of all the worms for storage, and a separate\nvector of pointers to the original Worms that we can iterate through. This makes is easier to act\nupon all worms but also makes it possible to e.g have multiple AI worms.\n\nWe do all Worm actions on the array of pointers, that way we can remove the worms that should no\nlonger be updated.\n\nI'll put the AI controls in a separate structure to separate the concerns of the the general worm\nlogic and the control of the worms.\n\nIf we were to create a bigger game, or the number of worms increase during play, the choice of a vector\nwould be bad as the rest of the framework expects stable pointers to the Worms. However here it is\nfine.\n\n\n## Update method messy\nUpdate method was a bit too messy to get a good overview of what it did and it had several\n\"distinct\" and locally unrelated parts. Decided to break it down into smaller phases, PlayerUpdate,\nAIUpdate, and Render\n\n\n## File structure\nI thought it is quite messy to have the Worm implementation and the general game logic\nimplementation in the same file. I moved Worm into its own header file.\n\n(Header file since the project is quite small and compile time is irrelevant)\n\nIn general, I also prefer to separate the definitions and declarations of code (even inline\nones) for the purpose of making it easier to get an overview of the API.\nI'll skip that here because the project is so small.\n\n\n# Quitting the game if player touches the ceiling wall\nSimple check after update to see if the player is inside of the bounds of the map. \nThis is done by checking the new head element of the player.\n\n\n## Collision handling / Ray intersection\nThe most computationally expensive task is going to be detecting collisions / intersections between\nobjects. While one can spend a lot of time optimizing various intersection algorithms the most\nefficent way of performing them is to not do it.\n\nI've decided to implement a grid based bucketing of objects on the map in the\n\"FCollisionGrid\". The idea is that we split the entire gaming area up into small sections in which\nwe register the objects in it. When checking for a collision we can then avoid doing intersection\nchecking on most of the things in the game world.\n\nI decided that each grid cell can contain at most 16 objects. If more objects are inserted in the\ncell, they are simply discarded from collision checking, this should be safe since the other objects\nin the same space should contain enough data for doing proper decisions.\n\nI decided to make each Grid 32 x 32 units big, this was chosen from the size of the worm\nhead. Adjusting this value for performance could be nice, however I'd avoid premature optmization.\n\nThe idea is that the Grid is reset between update calls and we write all world objects to it before\nany entity update.\n\nAs for the collision checks themselves I've added them in `WormsGame/Math.h`\n\n## Storage of points\nThe default implementation of how to store the \"Points\" of the worms used an std::vector which\nerases the first element every time it creates a new segment. While I've not measured the\nperformance impact of it, it gives me the petpeeves to see it there. I've therefore included a\nrudimentary implementation of an array based deque (The one in the standard library often uses a\nlinked list as a backend, that isn't much better than the original).\n\nA sad side effect is that I had to provide an alternative rendering method that acceps the deque\ninstead. I've done so in `FWormsVideoHelpExt.h`\n\n## Enemy AI\nThe AI sends out rays in 7 angles `{-100, -40, -15, 0, 15, 40, 100}`\nThe AI either has a target or goes straight ahead.\n\n- If the AI ray senses a danger (other worm or wall) it will panic and go in the other way.\n- If it senses multiple dangers it takes the average point of all dangers and goes the other way\n- If it discovers food it notes it down, it always notes down the closest food it knows about.\n- If it isn't in danger it will set the closest food item as the new target.\n- It remebers food even if it was scared away.\n- It will only attempt to chase a piece of food it found for at most 0.5 seconds. In order to stop\n  certain circling behaviour. This is not a good fix.\n\n\n## Paralellisation and optimization\nAfter doing all of the above I thought that the game performed reasonably well without any\nparallelisation. However, the game could almost trivially be parallelized in chunks as the game loop\nis split into three parallelizable chunks.\n\n\n## Audio\nRan out of time so decided to not do anything with it.\n",
